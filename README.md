# 1. Give execution permission to thingspeakmysql.sh
         chmod +x thingspeakmysql.sh
# 2. Execute the script thingspeakmysql.sh (only on the first time)
         ./thingspeakmysql.sh

# NB:  
	Execute the script thingspeakmysql.sh only on the first time because the database will be persist on the next time (volumes), just the thingspeakmysqlnew.sh is enough by executing ./thingspeakmysqlnew.sh
	Down't worry thingspeakmysqlnew.sh will be created after execution the script thingspeakmysql.sh
